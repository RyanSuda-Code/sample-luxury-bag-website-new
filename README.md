 HTML and CSS Learning Project

This is an ongoing project I created while learning CSS. I code as I learn, applying new concepts directly to this project. Working on it has helped me understand how to properly use class attributes, as well as how to work with width, height, margin, padding, colors, and various display properties.  

I will continue building and improving this project as I enhance my HTML and CSS skills.

Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS

## Code Snippets

```css
    * { 
  outline: 1px solid red;
} 
```
This is a debugging trick.
Developers use it to:

    See the exact size of every element

    Check layout issues

    Inspect spacing, overflow, unexpected gaps

    Visualize block/inline element
